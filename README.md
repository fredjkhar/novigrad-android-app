## About 

An Android application developed to assist individuals living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in managing their medications and injections. The app sends timely reminders to the user, prompting them to take their prescribed medication. Users can customize the notifications by specifying the medication name and type, as well as the date and time of the reminder. The app also offers a convenient feature that allows the user to track their injections and save the location of each injection for future reference. To ensure data security and reliability, the app utilizes Firebase Authentication to establish a secure authentication system, and stores all data on Firebase Cloud storage.
